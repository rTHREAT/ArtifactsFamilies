These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding how to act.

Window listings could convey information about how the system is used. For example, information about application windows could be used identify potential data to collect as well as identifying security tooling (Security Software Discovery) to evade.\nAdversaries typically abuse system features for this type of enumeration. For example, they may gather information through native system features such as Command and Scripting Interpreter commands and Native API functions.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "find graphical window"}]}, {"id": "T1082", "name": "System Information Discovery", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/", "description": "An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\nTools such as Systeminfo can be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather detailed system information (e.g. show version). System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "query environment variable"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "check OS version"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/ec05e37230e6534fa148b8e022f797ad0afe80f699fbd222a46672118663cf00/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
