Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size. Once executed, malware may also use File and Directory Discovery to check if it was saved in a folder or file with unexpected or even analysis-related naming artifacts such as malware, sample, or hash.\nOther common checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions. In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output. \nHardware checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.", "signatures": [{"severity": "LOW", "description": "system mem collect"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/e67e58bc736bd54e6915cb43af5f3c332da3592839a5a4884ba141b089310815/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
