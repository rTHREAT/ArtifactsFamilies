Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.\nSeveral types exist:\nBrowser-based Exploitation\nWeb browsers are a common target through Drive-by Compromise and Spearphishing Link. Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.\nOffice Applications\nCommon office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through Phishing. Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.\nCommon Third-party Applications\nOther applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation.

Malicious hooking mechanisms may capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials. Unlike Keylogging,  this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:\n\nHooks procedures, which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs.\nImport address table (IAT) hooking, which use modifications to a process\u2019s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.\nInline hooking, which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.\n", "signatures": [{"severity": "LOW", "description": "Modifies the prolog of usermode functions (usermode inline hooks)"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/86bcfce2dd342e9a1c04cfc65731d40ed1c397a4ec47bd9f5b41771297d81100/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
