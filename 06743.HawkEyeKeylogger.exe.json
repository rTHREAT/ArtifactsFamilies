In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers the file onto the victim's machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Downloads files from webservers via HTTP"}]}, {"id": "T1573", "name": "Encrypted Channel", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/", "description": "Adversaries may employ an encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.

Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts.
