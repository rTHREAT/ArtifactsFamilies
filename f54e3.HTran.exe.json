Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.\nRenaming abusable system utilities to evade security monitoring is also a form of Masquerading."}, {"id": "T1036.005", "name": "Match Legitimate Name or Location", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/", "description": "Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.\nAdversaries may also use the same icon of the file they are trying to mimic.", "signatures": [{"severity": "MEDIUM", "description": "create files to system directory common"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/f54e3c5a8f7851525a5d4ad7dc97d2f2d732d448b1ac39d8ce252243e0d0e293/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
